# Mathematics for Machine Learning

## 1. MIT OpenCourseWare
- [MIT 18.06, Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F)
  This course has several versions all of which are based on the lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang from Spring 2005.
  Watch the excellent introduction by himself: [Course Introduction | MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDFwVVKVk0&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C) 
  [MIT 18.06SC from Fall 2011](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C) includes recitations by 6 teaching assistanet between each lecture. If you want to go through the standard Linear Algebra subjects as quickly as possible, I recommend wataching Spring 2005 version without stopping and reviews. If you want to make sure whether you have understook the material coverd in each lecture enough, use Fall 2011 and solve the practice problem with the course TAs.

- [MIT 18.02, Multivariate Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38)
  The course has Homework help [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF07555F3CC669D01) based on Fall 2007 ectures by Prof Denis Auroux. The homework playlist has 70 videos. The first few lectures are essential for those who have not seen vectors and matrices before or need a big brushup. 

- MIT 18.650 Statistics for Applications, Fall 2016 [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60uVBMaoNERc6knT_MgPKS0]

- [MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k)

- MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, Fall 2010 [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7540DEDD482705B]

- [MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi) 
  Based on Fall 2010 lectures by Prof. Patrick Winston. The class is carried out with a set of panels of chalkboard he writes on, which is rare in teaching a subject like AI while many mathematics couress still uses chalkboard or whiteboard in many universties.  

- [MIT 18.03 Differential Equations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEC88901EBADDD980)
  Not directly relevant to the Machine Learing but everyone in the mathematics leaning field should know the    basic knowledge of differential equations and partical differential equations at the course level. Highly recomend for this class to 
  follow [MIT 18.03SC Differential Equations, Fall 2011](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL64BDFBDA2AF24F7E) to access     recitation videos that are more essential to viwew in this course.

- [MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1)
  Introductory calculus course lectured by Prof. David Jerison recorded in 2006, and has a few versions.
